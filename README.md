# MyBot

Creating a Discord Bot.

Not sure what it is going to do yet, but it is going to be made with js.

To start clone this repo. :)

Setup:
  1. run npm init in the cloned folder.
  2. please note your commits.
  3. I recomment setting up a .gitignore file.
  4. place the file name to be ignored and place the directory affixed with a /
  5. please make sure not to commit your config.json (Discord login) file.
